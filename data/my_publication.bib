Abstract = {{Directed evolution has been used for decades to engineer biological
   systems at or below the organismal level. Above the organismal level, a
   small number of studies have attempted to artificially select microbial
   ecosystems, with uneven and generally modest success. Our theoretical
   understanding of artificial ecosystem selection is limited, particularly
   for large assemblages of asexual organisms, and we know little about
   designing efficient methods to direct their evolution. Here, we have
   developed a flexible modelling framework that allows us to
   systematically probe any arbitrary selection strategy on any arbitrary
   set of communities and selected functions. By artificially selecting
   hundreds of in silico microbial metacommunities under identical
   conditions, we first show that the main breeding methods used to date,
   which do not necessarily let communities reach their ecological
   equilibrium, are outperformed by a simple screen of sufficiently mature
   communities. We then identify a range of alternative directed evolution
   strategies that, particularly when applied in combination, are well
   suited for the top-down engineering of large, diverse and stable
   microbial consortia. Our results emphasize that directed evolution
   allows an ecological structure-function landscape to be navigated in
   search of dynamically stable and ecologically resilient communities with
   desired quantitative attributes.
   A simulation study integrates existing artificial selection methods to
   develop a `top-down' approach to engineering complex, stable microbial
   communities based on iterated randomization and selection of community
   structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{Directed evolution is a form of artificial selection that has been used
   for decades to find biomolecules and organisms with new or enhanced
   functional traits. Directed evolution can be conceptualized as a guided
   exploration of the genotype-phenotype map, where genetic variants with
   desirable phenotypes are first selected and then mutagenized to search
   the genotype space for an even better mutant. In recent years, the idea
   of applying artificial selection to microbial communities has gained
   momentum. In this article, we review the main limitations of artificial
   selection when applied to large and diverse collectives of asexually
   dividing microbes and discuss how the tools of directed evolution may be
   deployed to engineer communities from the top down. We conceptualize
   directed evolution of microbial communities as a guided exploration of
   an ecological structure-function landscape and propose practical
   guidelines for navigating these ecological landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial selection is a promising approach to manipulate microbial
   communities. Here, we report the outcome of two artificial selection
   experiments at the microbial community level. Both used ``propagule{''}
   selection strategies, whereby the best-performing communities are used
   as the inocula to form a new generation of communities. Both experiments
   were contrasted to a random selection control. The first experiment used
   a defined set of strains as the starting inoculum, and the function
   under selection was the amylolytic activity of the consortia. The second
   experiment used multiple soil communities as the starting inocula, and
   the function under selection was the communities' cross-feeding
   potential. In both experiments, the selected communities reached a
   higher mean function than the control. In the first experiment, this was
   caused by a decline in function of the control, rather than an
   improvement of the selected line. In the second experiment, this
   response was fueled by the large initial variance in function across
   communities, and stopped when the top-performing community ``fixed{''}
   in the metacommunity. Our results are in agreement with basic
   expectations from breeding theory, pointing to some of the limitations
   of community-level selection experiments that can inform the design of
   future studies.}},

   The ecological implications of these cellular computations are poorly

   Our review identifies specific opportunities for integrating cellular
